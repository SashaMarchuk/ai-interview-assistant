## Out of Scope

Explicitly excluded. Documented to prevent scope creep.

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Additional STT providers (Whisper, AssemblyAI) | ElevenLabs sufficient for v1, reduces complexity |
| TTS audio feedback | Not needed for interview use case |
| Mobile support | tabCapture API not available on mobile |
| Server-side components | Fully client-side for privacy |
| Screen share invisibility mode | High complexity, ethical concerns, detection tools exist |
| Chrome Web Store distribution | Private use only |
| Auto language detection display | Implicit with ElevenLabs, not user-facing feature |
| Built-in mock interview system | Different product category |
